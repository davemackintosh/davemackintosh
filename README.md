### üëã I'm Dave Mackintosh, a full stack Software Developer with a strong focus on good human interaction, security and adding value using technology.

It all started when I was 8 years old in '96, when my granddad showed me some BASIC on his computer upstairs to control his telescope. 

This fascinated me enough to choose it as both my career and my hobby starting from hardware manufacturing to technical support and network engineer to now a full stack engineer with experience from circuit design to website design and delivery with almost everything in between.

When I'm not coding I'm usually cooking, cycling or walking with my family in the woods.

Technologies and concepts I'm good at and enjoy using:
