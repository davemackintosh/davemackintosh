### 👋 I'm Dave Mackintosh, I write code all day. I do this in the form of React, NodeJS, TypeScript and C/C++.

I like to collaborate in teams that are effective in change for the positive and help people enjoy every day by making their lives easier.

I've been writing code since I was 8 years old, when my granddad showed me some BASIC on his computer upstairs. This fascinated me enough to choose it as both my career and my hobby starting from technical support and network engineer to now a full stack engineer with experience from circuit design to website design and delivery.

When I'm not coding I'm usually cooking or walking with my family in the woods.

I am a freelancer based in the south of the UK and you can find me at the following links if you ever want to chat.
